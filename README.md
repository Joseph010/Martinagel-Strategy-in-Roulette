# Martinagel-Strategy-in-Roulette

The strategy is basic: You bet 1 on one of the 12's. If you lose you double the bet if you win you restart the bet as 1 on one of the 12's. In that way after you played x on the last bet and you win your total is being reduced to zero plus you earn x+1 amount of money. This program shows you if you have an winng strategy by your inputs.



# How to use

You can choose inital bet of yours. For example 2023

Then you are choosing your strategy: Always play on first 12 or always play on middle 12 or always play on last 12. And the 4th option is that fisrt play on first 12 then mid then last then first... 

After choosing strategy you are choosing when to stop. Lets say you wrote 2 then it means you are stopping when you reach 2X. You go till you bankrupt otherwise.

Then you are asked if you want to see all the details or not.
